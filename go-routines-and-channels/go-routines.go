// Goroutines let your program work on several different tasks at once.
// You goroutines can coordinate their work using channels, which let them send data to each other
// and synchronize so that one goroutine doesn't get ahead of another.

// Goroutines let you take full advantage of computers with multiple processors, so that your programs run as fast as possible!

	// parallelism: running tasks simultaneously. A computer with only one
	// processor can only run one task at a time. But most computers these days
	// have multiple processors (or one processor with multiple cores). Your
	// computer may divide concurrent tasks among different processors to run
	// them at the same time. (Itâ€™s rare to manage this directly; the operating
	// system usually handles it for you.
